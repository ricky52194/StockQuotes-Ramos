## Instructions:  

Create an StockQuote Android application using the Stock.java provided. Your application should be fully funtional and perform network retrieval for current stock quote for the stock symbol inputted by the user. Threading is required for this assignment. There is one requirements when the phone rotates: 1. All state of the app should be preserved. If I press 'G' and a 'O' and rotate the phone, I should be able to press 'O' and 'G' to continue 'GOOG'. Likewise, the returned values should also be maintained. Error handling must be implemented when an illegal symbol is typed in (see screenshot).

## WOW Factors:
1. The background has been changed to cyan.
2. Colorful, circular buttons to search and reset have been added.
3. The buttons have an added ripple effect every time they are pressed.
